# KDGO Website

### Layout Overview

**Pages:**  
Each page in the `pages/` folder represents a route on the website (e.g., `index.jsx` → `/`, `projects.jsx` → `/projects`).

**Components:**  
Reusable building blocks such as `Navbar`, `Footer`, and `HeroHeader`.  
Used to compose each page and keep the code modular.

**Data:**  
A mini “database” using JSON files that store information about projects, team members, and updates.

**Public:**  
Everything directly accessible on the website — such as images, CVs, or icons.

**Styles:**  
CSS files for global styling, component tweaks, and Windmill/Tailwind theme overrides.
